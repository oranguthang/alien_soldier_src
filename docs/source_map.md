# Source and subsystem map

The authoritative machine-readable map is `config/rom_layout.json`. The table
below is an orientation layer; exact ownership is checked from the assembler
listing by `make verify-layout`.

The ranges are intentionally address ordered. A broad owner is not proof that
every routine in that interval belongs to the named subsystem. As analysis
improves, modules may be split and moved between subsystem directories without
changing emitted order or bytes.
