# Tooling status

The release interface is the list in `config/release_0_5.json`. Those commands
are module-aware and are covered by the release gate.

The exploratory commands `analyze`, `find-unanalyzed`, `prepare-batch`, and
`rename` remain outside the release interface. The
`find-unanalyzed` selects hypothesis-level code procedures from the name audit
in ROM order; its queue is currently empty because no record retains that
evidence level. The six `unknown` records stay in `docs/unknowns.md`, not in
that automatic queue. `analyze` resolves selected names to owning modules and
perturbs a private worker copy, one worker by default; its emulator workflow
has not been rerun against the pinned host and movie, so its output is not
release evidence.
`debug-pointers` and `report-pointers` are retired safely: their old
address-name search found no current targets, and their cleanup could remove
prior diff data. `make verify-relocation` is the module-aware pointer check
used by the release gate. `make rename` preserves provenance, but a rename
still needs independent semantic evidence and `make verify`; the report's
processed flag is not proof.
The `set-movie`, `show-movie`, and `prepare-batch` recipes are portable Python
calls, and batch extraction follows the ROM-ordered modules. Their report
inputs remain exploratory rather than release evidence.

`find_unreferenced_labels.py` scans the ROM-ordered modules and their included
equate files, so references across module boundaries count. Its output means
only "no symbolic source reference": cartridge-header fields, raw-address
uses and runtime-computed references can still be live. The legacy
`split_data_from_listing.py` CLI is retired because it rewrote one source file
and emitted binaries outside the preservation asset manifest; use `make split`
for canonical extraction.

Read-only trace parsing and report generation do not mutate source and remain
useful, but their output is evidence only when its ROM, movie, emulator commit,
frame range, and interpretation are recorded.

The name-audit test discovers definitions across every `.s` and `.inc` module
in one pass and compares the resulting symbol set with the audit registry. This
preserves the exact missing-name check while avoiding one whole-source regular
expression scan per audit record; at 9,818 records the local test time fell from
about 271 seconds to less than one second.

`make semantic-audit` is the module-aware, read-only queue for the remaining
Sonnet-name review. It joins provenance-owning current definitions against the
exact current names in `config/name_audit.json`, reports the backlog by source
module, and separates binary-backed `_End` aliases from ordinary end labels
that still need semantic review. It never rewrites source and does not require
a listing, ROM build, trace, or emulator.
It also counts identical evidence sentences across exact-address records.
Run `python scripts/semantic_audit_queue.py --duplicate-bases --limit 10` to
see the largest groups with addresses and source modules, or add
`--basis-contains TEXT` to inspect every member of a matching group. Repetition
is a review queue, not proof of a bad name: ROM-ordered mapping records can
share a valid format explanation.
Reviewed groups live in `config/duplicate_basis_reviews.json`; their exact
addresses, current names, and modules must still match. The ordinary duplicate
listing omits accepted groups, while the summary reports both accepted and
open counts. `make release-audit` rejects a drifted review and will refuse
`tag-ready` while any group remains open.

`make trace` passes an inert screenshot interval to the pinned emulator. This
is required because that emulator currently evaluates its maximum-frame and
movie-finished termination checks only while screenshot automation is enabled.
The workaround produces no periodic captures, bounds the TAS trace at its
pinned 90,000-frame limit, and lets the longplay/menu traces stop at movie end
when a requested breakpoint is never reached. Rendering uses frameskip 8 to
keep a negative breakpoint search practical; emulated frame numbers and CPU
execution remain unchanged.
