# Type-$1C0 boss-family evidence and relocation fault

This page records what the Japanese ROM and source establish. It corrects the
earlier grouping of two adjacent but separate boss families under Sunset Sting.
The investigation originated in the parallel repacker worktree report
`unused_boss_entity_1c0.md`; no repacker feature or debug patch is required by
the preservation build.

## Ownership boundary

| Family | Entity types | Source | Observed mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | `$1C0`, `$1C4`, `$1C8` | `src/bosses/entity_type_1c0_core.s`, `entity_type_1c0_attacks.s`, `entity_type_1c0_transition_and_defeat.s` | Parent-linked body parts with radius and angle descriptors; second-form pool cleanup preserves `$1C8`. |
| B | `$1EC`, `$1F0`, `$1F4` | `src/bosses/sunset_sting_main.s`, `sunset_sting_segments.s`, `sunset_sting_wave.s` | Sixteen segments and a wave; its pool cleanup preserves `$1EC`. |

`Stage15_InitializeSunsetStingEncounter` loads the asset set whose entity type
is `$1EC`. TAS frame 32,124 shows its stretched appearance; frame 32,200
shows its pre-fight flower appearance. These observations do not assign an
appearance to family A. The former mixed transition module was split at
`$0427B0`; the tables at `$04258E` and `$0426DA` belong to family A, while
the following angle helpers are shared code.

The asset record `EntityType1C0AssetSet` at `$011538` contains type `$1C0`,
graphics pointer `$011542`, and palette pointer `$00C404`. No known stock
loader selects this record. A published patch replaces the Bugmax asset-set
record at `$01147C` with those three fields; the parallel worktree's
`Debug_LovePenguinPatch` reproduces that experiment. Its stage-13 password is
`2 A 4 1`. The patch's separate checksum-bypass edit at `$00036C` is not a
boss pointer. External material calls this art *Love Penguin*, but the ROM
evidence above only proves a type and two pointers. Source symbols therefore
use `EntityType1C0`, not a visual identity. The evidence does not establish
that no other, as-yet-unfound stock path could ever select the asset record.

## Hidden relocation failure

`EntityType1C0_BodyPartInitTable` begins at `$041568` and spans 244 bytes:
61 longwords. `EntityType1C0_InitBodyParts` reads each entry with
`move.l (a1)+`. The top bits indicate control data and which part field
receives the low-address portion; the next two words in a part record carry
additional parameters. Previously, 24 pointer-bearing longwords were
spelled as numeric `dc.w` pairs: five values equivalent to
`$20000000+EntityType1C0_EarlyFormPartMapping` (`$040D2E`) and 19 equivalent
to `$60000000+EntityType1C0_PartAnimationMappings` (`$041548`). The bytes at
`$040D2E` are a six-byte sprite mapping, not an unreferenced tail.

The table now uses 61 `dc.l` entries, including symbolic expressions for all
24 flagged pointers. This retains byte identity in the canonical layout but
lets the assembler move the addresses when preceding source grows. The
second-form body-part table was already written with longword symbols; two
tables feeding the same reader had disagreed in source type.

`make verify` compares bytes at the canonical positions, so it could not
detect the previous literal encoding. `make verify-relocation` checks
assembler-owned references, so it could not see addresses hidden as numbers.
Under a layout shift, stale pointers sent the sprite renderer into unrelated
mapping data; the sprite list filled and later sprites, including shots and
the weapon overlay, disappeared. This explains the repacker experiment, not
an observed fault in the preservation ROM.

The general check is reader-first: when code advances a table with
`move.l (aN)+`, inspect whether the table is typed as longwords and whether
any of those values are addresses. A disagreement between tables consumed by
the same reader is especially strong evidence. A broad scan for values that
look like addresses is noisy: the parallel investigation found 115 candidate
values in the moving region, mostly palette/config constants. A targeted
shift probe can confirm a candidate. Pointers into the fixed `org` regions
beginning at `$82324`, `$E8000`, `$180000`, and `$1FFFFF` correctly do not
shift.

## Remaining limits

The ROM-level identity of family A's art, any stock route selecting its asset
record, and the screen appearance of Sunset Sting's `$04309E` state have not
been demonstrated here. The source names do not depend on those claims.
