# External Dormant-Content Research Notes

This file preserves community patch notes collected from Zetaman videos and
The Cutting Room Floor. It is not authoritative evidence for source naming.
Unless a claim is tied to a live ROM consumer or a recorded runtime trace,
character identities, intended placement, and “unused” status remain external
attributions. Source symbols therefore use neutral entity-type names.

The patch bytes below are research inputs and have not yet been reproduced by
the release runtime suite. They must not be applied to the preservation build.

## Global Activation Code

Most unused features require the following ROM modification first:
```
ROM Offset 0x00036C: 4E 71 4E 71
```
This patches out a check that prevents unused content from loading. The bytes `4E 71` are the 68000 NOP instruction.

## Externally Attributed Entity Records

### Entity Type `$01C0`

Community material associates this record with “Love Penguin”. Static ROM
evidence establishes only the entity type and its resource set.

**Activation:**
```
ROM 0x00036C: 4E 71 4E 71   (global enable)
ROM 0x01147C: 01 C0 00 01 15 42 00 00 C4 04
```
Encounter at Stage 13.

**Current source locations:**

- Asset set: `EntityType1C0AssetSet`
- Graphics list: `EntityType1C0GraphicsLoadList`
- Graphics data: `tiles_11A8FC`
- Palette command: `EntityType1C0PaletteCommand`

---

### Entity Type `$03EC`

Community material associates this record with “Lambda Bunny”. That identity
is not encoded by the asset-set record or its Stage 18 table consumer.

**Activation:**
```
ROM 0x00036C: 4E 71 4E 71   (global enable)
ROM 0x0113B4: 03 EC 00 01 15 B2 00 00 C5 BE
```
Encounter at Stage 5 (convenient spawn area).

**Current source locations:**

- Asset set: `EntityType3ECAssetSet`
- Graphics list: `EntityType3ECGraphicsLoadList`
- Graphics data: `tiles_125902`
- Palette command: `EntityType3ECPaletteCommand`
- Stage entry: `Stage_InitBossPhase2`

---

### Entity Type `$03FC`

TCRF research associates this record with a dragon. Static source evidence
uses the neutral entity identity.

**Current source locations:**

- Asset set: `EntityType3FCAssetSet`
- Graphics list: `EntityType3FCGraphicsLoadList`
- Graphics data: `tiles_12D012`
- Palette commands: `EntityType3FCPaletteCommands`

---

### Entity Type `$03F0`

**Current source locations:**

- Asset set: `EntityType3F0AssetSet`
- Graphics list: `EntityType3F0GraphicsLoadList`
- Graphics data: `tiles_12772E`
- Palette command: `EntityType3F0PaletteCommand`
- Stage entry: `Stage_InitBossPhase3`

---

### Entity Type `$03F4`

Community guesses include Praying Mantis and Sigma Fox, but the ROM record does
not distinguish either identity.

**Current source locations:**

- Asset set: `EntityType3F4AssetSet`
- Graphics list: `EntityType3F4GraphicsLoadList`
- Graphics data: `tiles_12E96C`
- Palette commands: `EntityType3F4PaletteCommands`
- Stage entry: `Stage_InitBossPhase4`

## Notes on ROM Offsets

All ROM offsets are in hexadecimal. In the disassembly, these correspond to actual code/data addresses. The mapping needs to be established for each offset mentioned above.

**Common Pattern:**
- `4E 71` = NOP instruction (No Operation) in 68000 assembly
- Used to disable checks or skip unwanted code
