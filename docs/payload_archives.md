# Compressed payload boundaries

The preservation source includes the original bytes. Eight former payload files
contained two consecutive LZSS archives but exposed only the first archive's
name. The ranges below are now independent extracted assets and `binclude`
symbols. `tests/test_payload_archives.py` checks their headers, exact lengths,
decoded tile counts, and the pointers that use them.

| Second archive ROM address | First symbol | Second symbol | Decoded tiles |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| `$104F32` | `Stage15TileArt` | `Stage15TileArt2` | 28 |
| `$105B9E` | `Stage22And24TileArt` | `Stage22And24TileArt2` | 123 |
| `$123172` | `Boss_BackStringerTileArt` | `Boss_BackStringerTileArt2` | 27 |
| `$1291DE` | `EntityType3F0TileArt` | `UnreferencedEntityType3F0TileArt2` | 303 |
| `$138EE4` | `Boss_WolfGaropaTileArt1` | `UnreferencedWolfGaropaTileArt2` | 75 |
| `$13D42A` | `Boss_ZLeoTileArt1` | `UnreferencedZLeoTileArt2` | 322 |
| `$188A16` | `StoryScreenMappingData6000` | `UnreferencedIntroSceneSpriteArt` | 194 |
| `$1BE2CA` | `SevenForcesVictoryCutsceneMappingData4020` | `UnreferencedSevenForcesCutsceneTileArt` | 44 |

The first six second archives are in `data/artcomp/`; the last two follow
mapping payloads in `data/mappings/`. Their tile counts come from decoding the
individual second archives, not from their filenames. `Unreferenced` means no
even-aligned absolute pointer to the archive start was found in the canonical
ROM; it does not prove runtime inaccessibility.

Three compact load commands formerly formed a second-archive address by
adding the first archive's length. They now name the archive directly:

| Command | Former expression | Direct symbol |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Stage7TileAssetCommands` | `Stage15TileArt+$410` | `Stage15TileArt2` |
| `Stage16TileAssetCommands` | `Boss_VictorTileArt_End+$1840` | `Boss_BackStringerTileArt2` |
| `Stage18TileAssetCommands` | `Stage22And24TileArt+$A08` | `Stage22And24TileArt2` |

The original expression and direct symbol have exactly the same canonical
address. This fixes a source-level relocation hazard but does not establish
that it caused any observed rendering failure.

Two purported archive ends also had non-archive data after the compressed
stream. The archive at `$1BE2CA` ends at `$1BE722`; its 64-byte remainder is
`UnreferencedSevenForcesCutscenePostArtData`. The archive at `$19BF9E` ends at
`$19C492`; its 18-byte remainder is
`UnreferencedPostStageTileArtSpriteMapping`. The latter has three six-byte
sprite-command-shaped records, with the final record's high bit set. The
64-byte tail also begins with command-shaped records, but its full purpose and
visual owner remain unverified. Both retain role-neutral names pending a
reader trace. All 128 `artcomp` assets now end exactly at the first archive's
header-defined boundary. The extracted asset count is 589.

## Stage 4 rendering report: not reproduced in controlled shifts

The parallel repacker worktree reported a missing platform before Sniper
Honeyviper after moving payloads. Its saved `build/tmp_fullshift.bin` is
byte-for-byte the same image as `alien_soldier_shifted_godmode.bin`; its code
already differs from the canonical ROM at `$05E7`, and the pinned TAS shows a
different game state by frame 600. It cannot serve as a relocation-only
control for a Stage 4 regression. This does not disprove the original visual
observation; the exact failing screenshot, frame and build are not preserved
here.

On the current preservation branch, `shift_payloads.py` was run without a
debug define. It moved 190 original compressed payloads, unchanged, first by
16 bytes within a 2 MiB image and then by 8 KiB within a 4 MiB image. The
large-shift build also inserted 19,786 alignment bytes to keep DMA payloads
inside their `$20000`-byte blocks and updated the ROM header and checksum.
Both experimental ROMs assembled successfully.

The pinned emulator replayed each ROM and the canonical Japanese ROM with
the same movies. At 100-frame intervals through TAS frame 7000, all 70 PNGs
from each shifted ROM were byte-identical to the canonical captures. At
200-frame intervals through longplay frame 23600, all 118 PNGs from each
shifted ROM also matched; this includes all 14 sampled frames from 21000 to
23600 around Stage 4 and the boss entrance. These were sequential runs with
peak emulator memory below 48 MiB, not a full-game runtime proof. A brief
between-sample glitch or a different repacker variant remains untested.

Stage 4's compact asset list selects indices 0 and 8 in
`Stage_SharedTileSourceTable`. The two table pointers and the Sniper
Honeyviper tile-art bytes relocate in the saved shifted images; none of those
sources is simply omitted. The three corrected interior pointers above do
not belong to Stage 4. If the platform is still missing in another build, the
next input needed is that exact ROM plus its movie/frame or screenshot; then
the first divergent VRAM or tilemap transfer can be traced against this
controlled baseline. We do not attribute the non-reproduction specifically
to the archive split without that before/after control.
